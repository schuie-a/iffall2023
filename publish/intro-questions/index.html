            Name one way you expect designing for screen to be different from designing for paper.
        </b> <br/>
        You have to consider how the design looks on many different

            Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective design. Explain your choice.
        </b> <br/>
        <a href="https://www.moma.org/"> Moma</a> 
        I think that the MoMA website showcases really good design because 
        the colors and are really <br/> eyecatching and all of the links are 
        easy to follow yet still interesting and typeset well.

        </b> <br/>
        <a href="https://www.amherstdowntown.com/"> Amherst Downtown</a> 
        I think that Amherst Downtown has effective communication because they are <br/>
        really focused on ensuring that the people looking at the website have links to information that they need <br/>
         and have lists of things that they are looking for.

        <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/"> Pinterest</a> 
        Pinterest does a really great job with their algorithm. They are 
        so good at finding content that you like <br/> and also the way that they 
        allow you to categorize and sort your own information is really nice 
        as well. <br/> Overall a great time to be on Pinterest.
