            2:00 a.m. and I can't sleep once again <br>
            I keep having that recurring dream<br>
            That I'm sitting on a boat with a bunch of men (men, men, men)<br>
            I finally know what it means<br>
            But I'm scared that you won't understand<br>
            That you won't understand<br>
            <br>

            Something's not right, something's not right<br>
            No, something's not right with your boy <br>
            Something's not right, something's not right<br>

            I know my calling<br>
            I'm a pirate and I'm sailing away from the haters<br>
            The ocean is calling out to me and my parrot<br>
            And we're gonna burn this whole city down<br>

            Yo-ho, motherfucker, I'm a pirate now<br>
            Yo-ho, motherfucker<br>

            <p class="p">
            I belong at sea roaming port to port <br>
            Stealing treasure chests from an enemy's fort <br>
            Drinking tons of rum with my pirate buds <br>
            They will show me the ropes <br>
            Sing with me yo-ho <br>
            Show me the ropes <br>
            Sing with me yo-ho<br>
            <br>

            But first I need a hook hand, hook hand <br>
            Gonna need a peg leg, peg leg <br>
            Someone poke my eye out for my eye patch <br>
            <br>

            I finally did it, I moved to the Caribbean <br>
            Famously, that's where they're from <br>
            But no pirates there, just a bunch of rum (rum, rum, rum)<br>
            But that's where I met Marc<br>
            He's my new friend<br>
            My island 'til I die friend<br>
            He's a big strong beautiful man<br>
            Marc flies planes, and planes are cool<br>
            And a plane's much faster than a boat (a boat)<br>
            The sky is the limit when you're in a plane<br>

            I know my calling, I'm a pilot <br>
            And I'm flying away from you posers<br>
            Marc said he'll teach me, it looks pretty easy<br>
            And I'm gonna shake my ass in the clouds<br>
            Wheels up, motherfucker, I'm a pilot now<br>

            The truth is I'm not a pirate or a pilot<br>
            I'll never be a fireman or a cop<br>

            A dream to be human and have a job<br>
