        <li>1/2 c. granulated sugar (105 g.)</li>
        <li>2 tsp. kosher salt (12 g.)</li>

        For the eggwash
    </h2>
    <ol type="1" class="ingList">
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 tbsp. water</li>
        <li>Kosher or sea salt, for sprinkling</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>
        Directions
    </h2>
    <h2 class="subHead">
        Step One 
    </h2>
    <p>
        Make the sponge: To the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the hook attachment, add 1 cup flour, yeast, and milk. Using a spatula, mix until well combined, then cover with plastic wrap and let sit for 45 minutes.
    </p>
    <h2 class="subHead">
        Step Two
    </h2>
    <p>
        Once the sponge has formed some air pockets, add in eggs, remaining 3 cups flour, sugar, and salt. Mix on medium speed until well combined, then gradually increase to medium-high speed and continue mixing until dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl and becomes shiny and elastic, scraping down bowl every 4 to 5 minutes, 10 to 13 minutes.
    </p>
    <h2 class="subHead">
        Step Three
    </h2>
    <p>
        With the mixer running, add in butter gradually, 1 tablespoon at a time, letting each tablespoon fully incorporate into the dough before adding the next, 13 to 15 minutes. Continue mixing on medium-high speed for 5 to 7 minutes until the dough passes the windowpane test. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let rest about 1 hour or doubled in size.
    </p>
    <h2 class="subHead">
        Step Four
    </h2>
    <p>
        To bake next day: Once dough has doubled in size, punch down to deflate dough completely, then re-cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate overnight until you are ready to bake the next day. Follow instructions in the next step, letting dough proof until doubled before baking, longer if needed, up to 2 hours 30 minutes.
    </p>
    <h2 class="subHead">
        Step Five
    </h2>
    <p>
        To bake same day: Once dough has doubled in size, turn out onto a floured surface and punch down dough. Divide in half using a bench scraper. Cut each half into six equal pieces. Flatten each piece into a rectangle, then fold short ends in towards each other as if folding a letter. Flatten again and tightly roll into a log starting with the short end. Repeat with all pieces. 
    </p>
    <h2 class="subHead">
        Step Six
    </h2>
    <p>
        Grease 8”-x-5” loaf pans with butter. Place 6 pieces of dough seam-side down in one straight row into each prepared pan. Cover with plastic wrap.
    </p>
    <h2 class="subHead">
        Step Seven
    </h2>
    <p>
        Preheat oven to 375°. Let dough proof until puffy and doubled in size, 1 hour to 1 hour 30 minutes. In a small bowl, whisk together remaining egg and water. Brush egg wash on top of loaf and sprinkle lightly with salt.
    </p>
    <h2 class="subHead">
        Step Eight
    </h2>
    <p>
        Bake until deeply golden on top and the center of the loaf registers between 190° and 205°, about 30 minutes.
    </p>
    <h2 class="subHead">
        Step Nine
    </h2>
    <p>
        Let cool 5 minutes then turn loaves out onto a cooling rack. Let cool completely.

                I really like this website because they make key information really clear upon the first click. It has the baking time, prep time, and total time laid out and large. There isn't an overly large intro; it is quick and straight to the point.

                I think that they do a good job of breaking up information into digestible parts. You can easily find the level of difficulty, the video to follow along, and the ingredients with little fuss.

                I really like how they have decided to add an image to accompany each step. The website is formatted in a very linear fashion which works well in terms of following a list of instructions. It is clear that they kept in mind the audience of a simple recipe and aimed to be as descriptive as possible.

                    Pinterest does such a good job of curating a mass amount of information without making it overwhelming to the viewer. Their use of grids and very well ordered informaion allows someone to quickly take in all that the website has to offer.

                    I really like the use of illustrations and blocks of color on this site. There are only a few options for you to click onto, which works really well when you are panicked about a problem. I have spent my fair share of time here, and while I never enjoyed it, they could have made it much worse.

                    I really like the color scheme with this site. I have been on it for the first time this semester, and the way that they interspace explanations and examples and charts works very well for me.
